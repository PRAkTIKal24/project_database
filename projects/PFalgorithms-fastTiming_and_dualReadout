shortdescription: Improving Particle Flow Algorithms through the incorporation of fast-timing and dual-readout
description: >
Machine learning is having a transformative impact in collider detectors, both at the LHC, and 
also in the context of future colliders. While many efforts in particle flow reconstruction are 
being pursued, there are unique new opportunities that are largely unexplored and have the potential 
to significantly enhance this area of research. In particular, the incorporation of fast-timing 
and dual-readout information. Fast-timing provides a new dimension to calorimetry. In the case of 
high granularity calorimeters, cell-time information can be utilized to better resolve nearby 
hadronic showers. The overlap/confusion between nearby showers is what limits existing AI/ML 
particle flow algorithms as there is not enough information to disentangle such overlaps purely 
based on spatial information. On the other, dual-readout calorimeter cells/fibers allow for a new 
type of particle flow algorithm. The key idea is that dual-readout provides excellent energy resolution, 
so, in contrast with traditional particle flow where the main handle is high-resolution spatial information, 
in dual-readout it is the energy resolution what can enable improved association between tracks and 
calorimeter signals. This calls for a new class of particle flow algorithm that has yet to be developed. 
Achieving the full potential of these ideas requires a team with strong knowledge and combined expertise 
in calorimetry, jet physics, and AI/ML methods. This project presents an opportunity to explore these 
cutting-edge computing algorithms and methods with the goal of realizing the next generation of 
particle flow reconstruction for future colliders.

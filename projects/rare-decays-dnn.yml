shortdescription: Deep neural net topological tagger for rare hadron decay identification
description: >
  The CMS experiment provides a unique opportunity to study extremely rare hadron
  decays due to a significantly larger amount of data compared with the LHCb and
  Belle II experiments. The main challenge is to identify such decays and suppress
  associated backgrounds in the high pile-up environment. In this project, we will
  use a Deep Neural Network to develop a new method of tagging such decays using
  topological information to identify the relevant charged tracks associated with
  the decays of interest. The project requires familiarity with machine learning
  algorithms and tools to build and train deep neural networks. It will involve
  testing different DNN types and feature engineering.

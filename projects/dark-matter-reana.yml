shortdescription: Implement a REANA workflow for dark matter searches at RCFM
description: >
  [REANA](https://reana.io/) is a platform for reproducible data analysis workflows
  that can be run at scale. REANA has been used extensively for running containerized
  workflows of LHC experiments, like ATLAS, and for reinterpretation of published
  analyses. This project would aim to implement a REANA workflow for a galaxy
  rotation-curve fitting analysis (RCFM) to improve replicability and to
  provide a starting point for future work.

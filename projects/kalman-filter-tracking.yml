shortdescription: Combining Kalman filters and ML for particle tracking
description: >
  When a charged particle traverses a detector, it leaves traces of its passage in the form of hits.
  These hits are used to reconstruct the particle's trajectory, which is essential for understanding the particle's properties.
  The Kalman filter is a widely used algorithm for tracking particles in high-energy physics experiments.
  It is an iterative algorithm that estimates the particle's trajectory by combining the measurements from the
  detector with the predictions from the previous step.
  In this project, we will explore how machine learning methods can be combined with the Kalman filter to improve the tracking performance.
  The goal is to develop a hybrid tracking algorithm that leverages the strengths of both approaches.
  Code will be provided as a starting point, and the student is encouraged to experiment with different architectures
  and be creative. The project will use Python and Pytorch.

shortdescription: "Add support for writing ragged arrays as std::vectors to Uproot"
description: >
  Uproot can write ragged data as dynamic arrays, but ROOT requires
  TBranches of this type (e.g. `Muon_pt`) to be accompanied by a
  "counter" TBranch (e.g. `nMuon`), which can be cumbersome when
  writing many ragged arrays, some with the same dimensions, others
  with different dimensions. `std::vectors` do not require "counter"
  TBranches, but they're expressed in a different format that would
  have to be handled separately. It is an often-requested feature,
  though (see
  [uproot#257](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5/issues/257)).

shortdescription: Optimization of charged-particle reconstruction algorithms in future Muon Colliders
description: >
  A muon-collider has been proposed as a possible path for future high-energy physics.
  The design of a detector for a muon collider has to cope with a large
  rate of beam-induced background, resulting in an unprecedentedly large multplicity of particles entering the
  detector that are unrelated to the main muon-muon collision.
  The algorithms used for charged particle reconstruction (tracking) need to cope with such "noise" and be
  able to successfully reconstruct the trajectories of the particles of interest, which results
  in a very large conbinatorial problem that challenges the approaches adopted so far.
  The project consists of investigating how the tracking algorithms can be improved by utilizing a combination of
  directional information from specially-arranged silicon-detector layers and more advanced reconstruction techniques and algorithms
  available in the experiment-generic ACTS tracking library adapted to the specific environment expected for a Muon Collider detector.
  The project allows the fellow to mix acquiring good technical skills and the ability to innovate state-of-the-art tracking algorithms in this less-explored environment.

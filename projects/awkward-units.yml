shortdescription: 'Adding "units" as Awkward Array metadata and conversions as behaviors'
description: >
  Awkward Arrays already have an
  [ak.Array.attrs](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/reference/generated/ak.Array.html#ak.Array.attrs)
  attribute that can carry arbitrary metadata (persistent or
  transient) and an
  [ak.behavior](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/reference/ak.behavior.html)
  that attaches functionality to arrays. One, the other, or both of
  these would be able to implement physical units on arrays and
  convert between units when appropriate, such as putting two arrays
  into common units before adding
  them. [awkward#2468](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/issues/2468)
  is a discussion of this feature and possible implementations.

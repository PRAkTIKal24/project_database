shortdescription: Replacing the fastjet implementation with safe, maintainable LayoutBuilder while retaining its interface

description: >
  [fastjet](https://github.com/scikit-hep/fastjet) is a Python interface to the
  popular [FastJet](https://fastjet.fr/) particle-clustering package, which is
  written in C++. fastjet is unique in that it offers a
  [vectorized interface](https://fastjet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Awkward.html)
  to FastJet's algorithms, allowing Python users to analyze many collision
  events in a single function call, avoiding the overhead of Python iteration.
  Collections of particles and jets with different lengths per event are managed
  by [Awkward Array](https://awkward-array.org/). Although the fastjet package
  functions and is currently used in HEP analysis, its Python-C++ interface
  predates [LayoutBuilder](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/user-guide/how-to-use-header-only-layoutbuilder.html),
  which simplifies the construction of Awkward Arrays in C++, is easier to
  maintain, and avoids the dangers of raw array handling. This project would be
  to refactor fastjet to use the new abstraction layer, maintaining its
  well-tested interface, and possibly adding new algorithms and functionality
  new algorithms and functionality, such as
  [jet groomers and other transformations](https://github.com/scikit-hep/fastjet/discussions/170).

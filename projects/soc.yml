shortdescription: Embedded software application for a RISC-V based system-on-chip (SoC) for LHCb Velo detector.
description: >
  At the CERN Microelectronics section, we are in the process of developing
  a custom RISC-V based system-on-chip (SoC) generator. This will be used to embed
  on-chip processors and programmability into ASICs for multiple experiments.

  The student will participate developing the specific embedded software applications (C++/Python)
  for various operations targeting the custom processorÂ system.
  If interested, the student can also participate in the development of software tools used to
  build the custom hardware system.

  The first prototype will be part of the LHCb Velo detector and possibly the CMS tracker.

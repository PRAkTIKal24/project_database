shortdescription: Data processing of CMS Level 1 trigger 40 MHz scouting for luminosity measurement
description: >
  In High-Luminosity LHC era the CMS 40 MHz L1 Scouting system will be used for luminosity measurements 
  by counting multiple trigger primitives, as muon stubs, energy deposition in calorimeters, 
  track primitives, and others. A detailed study of these primitives and their correlations is 
  required to determine their suitability for precision luminosity measurement in the HL-LHC conditions. 
  A prototype of the system has already been deployed as a Run 3 demonstrator, and data is available 
  for analysis. Students involved in this project will gain experience with the CMS data flow, 
  including the use of the CMS Software Framework (CMSSW) and HTCondor for large-scale data processing.

shortdescription: Optimization of material activation correction for CMS Forward calorimeter data
description: >
  The Beam Radiation Instrumentation and Luminosity (BRIL) project focuses on precision
  luminosity measurements and beam-induced background studies. One of the primary systems
  used for precise luminosity measurement is the Forward Hadron (HF) Calorimeter.
  While HF provides excellent stability and linearity, the detector is susceptible to
  significant radiation activation. This activation, involving multiple short-lived
  isotopes with typical lifetimes of hundreds of nanoseconds, can introduce biases
  in measurements taken every 25 ns . Another potential source of systematic uncertainty
  arises from imperfections in the timing alignment of the detector, leading to signal
  spillover into neighboring measurement slices or bunch-crossings. To correct these effects,
  a multi-parameter fit should be derived and applied to the full year of data,
  significantly impacting the final luminosity measurement. Students participating
  in this project will gain insights into data analyses, work with Python-based data
  processing tools, including pandas and numpy.

shortdescription: New Frontiers in 5D Calorimeter Reconstruction
description: >
  Machine learning is having a transformative impact in collider detectors, both at the LHC, and
  also in the context of future colliders. While many efforts in particle flow reconstruction are being
  pursued, there are unique new opportunities that are largely unexplored and have the potential to
  significantly enhance this area of research. In particular, the incorporation of fast-timing
  with dual-readout information. Fast-timing provides a new dimension to calorimetry. In the case
  of high granularity calorimeters, cell-time information can be utilized to better resolve nearby
  hadronic showers and improve the jet energy resolution beyond what can be achieved with existing
  AI/ML particle flow methods. This project consists of exploring a new frontier for particle flow
  reconstruction incorporating fast timing and dual readout information. The goal is to investigate
  how to combine fast-timing information with dual readout signals and tracks using modern machine
  learning techniques. This project presents an opportunity to explore cutting-edge calorimetry
  technology and computing algorithms and methods with the goal of realizing the next generation
  of 5D (x,y,z,t,E) particle flow reconstruction for future colliders.

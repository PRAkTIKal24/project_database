shortdescription: Package HEP tools for conda-forge
description: >
  One common toolchain used in high energy physics for simulation is:
  [MadGraph5_aMC@NLO](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) to
  [PYTHIA8](https://pythia.org/) to [Delphes](https://github.com/delphes/delphes).
  Installing these tools can be challenging at times, especially for new users.
  [Conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) allows for distribution of arbitrarily
  complex binaries across multiple platforms though the conda/mamba/micromamba/pixi
  package management ecosystem.
  As [ROOT](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/root/) has been successfully packaged and
  distributed on conda-forge along with the
  [PYTHIA8 Python bindings](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pythia8/) it should be
  possible to package all the components of the HEP simulation stack and distribute
  them on conda-forge.

  However, the interconnected nature of some of these tools requires that multiple
  dependencies are first packaged and distributed before the full stack can be.
  This project would attempt to package as many of the dependencies of the broader HEP
  simulation stack on conda-forge as possible starting with those outlined
  in the
  [HEP Packaging Coordination list](https://github.com/hep-packaging-coordination/packaging-hep-simulation-stack/issues/1)
  and additionally contribute to the maintenance of the
  [ROOT feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/root-feedstock) on conda-forge.

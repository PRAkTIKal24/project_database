shortdescription: Development of coffea to support multiple LHC experiment analysis workflows

description: >
  As the [coffea](https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/) analysis framework has continued
  to gain use across the CMS experiment and is beginning to be used more in ATLAS, the
  amount of experiment specific code has grown as well.
  With coffea's recent transition in late 2023 to be more Dask focused there is work to be
  done to support experiment specific areas, such as the ATLAS specific
  `coffea.nanoevents.PHYSLITESchema`, while still focusing on performance and user needs.
  This project would support the general development of coffea with a focus on targeting
  experiment specific code to support and improve the user experience and would have
  the Fellow work closely with the coffea core team.

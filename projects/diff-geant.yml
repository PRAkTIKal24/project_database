shortdescription: Developing an automatic differentiation and initial parameters optimisation pipeline for the particle shower model.
description: >
  The goal of this project is to develop a differentiable simulation and
  optimization pipeline for Geant4. The narrow task of this Fellowship project
  is to develop a trial automatic differentiation and backpropagation pipeline
  for the Markov-like stochastic branching process that is modeling a particle
  shower spreading inside a detector material in three spatial dimensions.

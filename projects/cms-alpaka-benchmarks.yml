shortdescription: Writing benchmarks for the [alpaka](https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka) performance portability library.
description: >
  This project proposes to write benchmarks for the [alpaka](https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka)
  performance portability library to evaluate the performance of using various parallel constructs
  in the [pixel track](https://github.com/cms-patatrack/pixeltrack-standalone/) reconstruction software
  of the CMS experiment at CERN, and other software. The alpaka library facilitates development across diverse
  hardware architectures by providing a unified API for writing parallel software for CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.
  As the complexity of scientific software and alpaka itself grows, we need to continuously monitor the performance
  of its modules.

  The student's task will be to write performance benchmarks for alpaka in C++.
  In future, running these benchamerks will be integrated into our CI (Continuous Integration) and Unit Testing systems.
  A benchmark is a piece of C++ code written against the alpaka API that tests a specific functionality in alpaka,
  and measures its performance. The benchmarks range in complexity from short functions testing
  a single isolated feature, similar to a unit test, to complex algorithms that measure the performance
  of several modules interacting with each other. The project will start with short single-purpose benchmarks
  which will gradually introduce the student to the basics of using alpaka API and its different modules
  so that they can tackle complex challenging tasks in the later phases of the project.

  Students participating in this project will have the opportunity to contribute to programming
  a state-of-the-art C++ library, engaging directly with a developer group that adheres
  to the best software programming practices. They will gain hands-on experience in developing
  and implementing advanced computational solutions within a real-world scientific framework,
  enhancing their technical skills in high-performance computing and software development
  within a collaborative and cutting-edge research environment.

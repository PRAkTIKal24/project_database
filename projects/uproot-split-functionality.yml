shortdescription: "Split Uproot into two phases: metadata-reading and data-reading"
description: >
  Uproot is designed for interactive use: a user specifies a file to
  open, Uproot reads the file's metadata, and then the user specifies
  which TBranches to read as arrays. However, in high-throughput
  situations, the metadata-reading (implemented in pure Python) is a
  bottleneckâ€”it would be better to jump directly to the
  high-performance array-reading. This can be done by using Uproot in
  two passes: the first pass reads all the metadata and stores it in a
  database (once), and the second pass uses the database to jump
  directly to the seek locations of array data (many times). This is
  conceptually similar to what
  [kerchunk](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/) does with other file
  formats (making ROOT a kerchunk format is one possible
  implementation), and a demonstrator for this concept was implemented
  using the Tiled database as
  [tiled-uproot](https://github.com/jpivarski/tiled-uproot). This
  project would be to decide on a database format and implement
  two-phase reading with a nice interface.

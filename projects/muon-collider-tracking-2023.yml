shortdescription: Simulation and Charged-particle reconstruction algorithms in future Muon Colliders
description: >
  A muon-collider has been proposed as a possible path for future high-energy physics.
  The design of a detector for a muon collider has to cope with a large
  rate of beam-induced background, resulting in an unprecedentedly large multplicity of particles entering the
  detector that are unrelated to the main muon-muon collision.
  The algorithms used for charged particle reconstruction (tracking) need to cope with such "noise" and be
  able to successfully reconstruct the trajectories of the particles of interest, which results
  in a very large conbinatorial problem that challenges the approaches adopted so far.
  The project consists of two complementary objectives. In the first one, we will investigate how the tracking algorithms can
  be improved by utilizing directional information from specially-arranged silicon-detector layers; this requires improving
  the simulation of the detector as well. The second one, aims to port the modern track reconstruction algorithms we are
  using from the older ILCSoft framework to the new Key4HEP software framework, which supports parallel multi-threaded execution
  of algorithms and will be needed to scale performance to the needs of the Collaboration, validate them and ensure they can be widely
  used by all collaborators.

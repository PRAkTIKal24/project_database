shortdescription: Developing a Pythonic tool for smoothing histograms
description: Histograms are fundamental objects in statistical modelling frameworks used in many Large Hadron Collider (LHC) analyses. They serve as the primary representation of both experimental data and theoretical predictions, with systematic uncertainties often modelled as variations on these histograms. Smoothing refers to techniques that reduce statistical noise in histograms, enhancing the stability of statistical models and ultimately leading to more reliable results in physics analyses. While smoothing is essential for analyses, existing tools lack accessible interfaces, comprehensive documentation, and integration into the Scikit-HEP ecosystems. This project aims to address this gap by developing a smoothing tool in Python based on existing algorithms, enabling physicists to apply smoothing methods more efficiently and consistently in their workflows.

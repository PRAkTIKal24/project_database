shortdescription: Adopting Analysis Grand Challenge (AGC) for Kubeflow MLOps platform
description: >
  The Analysis Grand Challenge (AGC) is performing the last steps in an analysis pipeline at scale to test workflows envisioned for the HL-LHC.
  The goal of this project is to adopt Kubeflow Pipelines for the AGC machine learning workflow. Kubeflow is an open source platform for implementing MLOps, providing a framework for building, deploying, and managing machine learning workflows.

shortdescription: Create an Analysis Grand Challenge implementation using ATLAS PHYSLITE data
description: >
  The IRIS-HEP Analysis Grand Challenge (AGC) is a realistic environment for investigating how high energy physics data analysis workflows scale to the demands
  of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). It captures relevant workflow aspects from data delivery to statistical inference. The AGC has so far been based on
  publicly available Open Data from the CMS experiment. The ATLAS collaboration aims to use a data format called PHYSLITE at the HL-LHC, which slightly differs
  from the data formats used so far within the AGC. This project involves implementing the capability to analyze PHYSLITE ATLAS data within the AGC workflow and
  optimizing the related performance under large volumes of data. In addition to this, the evaluation of systematic uncertainties for ATLAS with PHYSLITE is
  expected to differ in some aspects from what the AGC has considered thus far. This project will also investigate workflows to integrate the evaluation of such
  sources of uncertainty within a Python-based implementation of an AGC analysis task.

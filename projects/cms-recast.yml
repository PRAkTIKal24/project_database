shortdescription: Implement a CMS analysis with RECAST and REANA
description: >
  [RECAST](https://iris-hep.org/projects/recast.html) is a platform for systematic
  interpretation of LHC searches.
  It reuses preserved analysis workflows from the LHC experiments, which is now
  possible with containerization and tools such as [REANA](http://reanahub.io).
  Recently, IRIS-HEP and the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) supported an [analysis
  preservation bootcamp at CERN](/2020/02/17/analysis-preservation.html) teaching
  these tools. Furthermore, the ATLAS experiment is now actively using RECAST. We
  seek a member of CMS to incorporate a CMS analysis into the system with support
  from IRIS-HEP, REANA, and RECAST developers. The analysis can be done using CMS
  internal data or CMS open data and would use CMS analysis tooling.

shortdescription: Building an Acknowledgement Plugin for the Alarms and Alerts System
description: |
  perfSONAR is a widely-used monitoring framework for Research and Education networks,
  which are critical to supporting global scientific collaboration. These high-speed
  networks connect universities, research institutes, and laboratories,
  enabling massive data transfers and providing the backbone for international science
  projects. The Alarms and Alerts schedulers process millions of daily network tests
  and produce alarms which aim to alert site administrators and scientists using the
  computing grid, about current network problems. By improving how these alerts are
  managed and acknowledged, you’ll help ensure that researchers worldwide can rely on
  stable, high-performing connections to conduct their work without interruptions.

  The project involves enhancing an existing alert subscription frontend that notifies
  users of network issues. Your main responsibility will be implementing a new feature
  allowing administrators to acknowledge alarms, signaling that they are working on
  the issue. If time allows, you’ll also explore adding new alarm types to expand the
  system’s usefulness. These changes will help site admins react to problems more
  efficiently, reducing downtime and ensuring the smooth operation of a global research
  network that serves critical scientific projects.

  You work within a pre-established framework and codebase, integrating your
  contributions with the current front-end. You’ll learn how to connect the user
  interface with backend logic to handle alarm status changes, enabling clear
  visibility into which issues are being addressed. The goal is to produce a polished
  feature that is both functional and user-friendly. Throughout the project, we
  expect regular check-ins (e.g., weekly) to help you stay on track and to provide
  guidance.

  Learning Experience
  You’ll gain experience integrating code into an existing system, working on both
  front-end and back-end components. You’ll learn to implement new features in a
  eal-world environment, collaborate with experienced developers, and test your code
  under various scenarios. This project provides an opportunity to sharpen your
  full-stack development skills, while directly supporting a global scientific
  community.

  Preferred Skills

  * Familiarity with modern web development tools and languages.
  * Some experience working with Jupyter Notebooks, Python and REST APIs.

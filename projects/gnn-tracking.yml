shortdescription: Reconstruct the trajectories of particle with graph neural networks
description: |
  In the GNN tracking project, we use [graph neural networks][gnn-wiki] (GNNs) to reconstruct trajectories ("tracks") of elementary particles traveling through
  a detector.
  This task is called ["tracking"][tracking-wiki] and is different from many other problems that involve trajectories:
  * there are several thousand particles that need to be tracked at once,
  * there is no time information (the particles travel too fast),
  * we do not observe a continuous trajectory but instead only around five points ("hits") along the way in different detector layers.

  The task can be described as a combinatorically very challenging "connect-the-dots" problem, essentially turning a cloud of points (hits) in 3D space into a
  set of O(1000) trajectories. Expressed differently, each hit (containing not much more than the x/y/z coordinate) must be assigned to the particle/track it
  belongs to.

  A conceptually simple way to turn this problem into a machine learning task is to create a fully connected graph of all points and then train an edge
  classifier to reject any edge that doesn't connect points that belong to the same particle. In this way, only the individual trajectories remain as components
  of the initial fully connected graph. However, this strategy does not seem to lead to perfect results in practice. The approach of this project uses this
  strategy only as the first step to arrive at "small" graphs. It then projects all hits into a learned latent space with the model learning to place hits of
  the same particle close to each other, such that the hits belonging to the same particle form clusters.

  The project code together with documentation and a reading list is available on [github][ghorganization] and uses [pytorch geometric][pyg]. See also [our GSoC
  proposal for the same project][gsoc-proposal], which lists prerequisites and possible tasks.

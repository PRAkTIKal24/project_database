shortdescription: "Test and identify missing capabilities in the Scikit-HEP GPU ecosystem"
description: >
  Awkward Array's CUDA kernels and Numba-CUDA support exist (see [this
  training](https://hsf-training.github.io/array-oriented-programming/5-gpu.html#awkward-array)),
  as well as
  [cuda-histogram](https://github.com/scikit-hep/cuda-histogram), but
  these features haven't been heavily tested and probably haven't ever
  been used in an analysis. This project would be to try using
  Scikit-HEP libraries (including Vector and any other relevant
  libraries) in an analysis using GPUs to find out what the pain
  points are, and either fixing them directly or raising awareness
  among the developers.

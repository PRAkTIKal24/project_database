shortdescription: Predict data popularity to improve its availability for physics analysis
description: >
  The CMS data management team is responsible for distributing data among computing centers worldwide. Given the limited disk space at these sites, the team
  must dynamically manage the available data on disk. Whenever users attempt to access unavailable data, they are required to wait for the data to be retrieved
  from permanent tape storage. This delay impedes data analysis and hinders the scientific productivity of the collaboration. The objective of this project is
  to create a tool that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict which data should be retained, based on current usage patterns.

shortdescription: "Implement the remaining functions to make Ragged an Array-API compliant ragged array library"
description: >
  Scikit-HEP's
  [Ragged](https://github.com/scikit-hep/ragged/discussions/6) library
  is an interface over Awkward Array that restricts it to ragged
  arrays only (no records, missing data, etc.)  and satisfies
  DataAPI's [Array API](https://data-apis.org/), which is rapidly
  becoming the standard interface for array libraries. As such, the
  requirements for Ragged are very precise: all required functions
  have already been stubbed out with full docstrings, and about half
  of them have been implemented. This project would be to complete it
  and promote it as a fully functional, Array API-compliant ragged
  array library.

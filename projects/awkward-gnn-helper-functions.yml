shortdescription: "Helper functions to turn Awkward records into array dimensions and PyG indexes"
description: >
  Awkward Array has functions to convert to and from TensorFlow and
  PyTorch, such as
  [ak.from_raggedtensor](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/reference/generated/ak.from_raggedtensor.html)
  and following, with support for TensorFlow's RaggedTensor. However,
  there are format conversions that still have to be handled manually,
  such as turning an Awkward Array of records (e.g. muon with pT, eta,
  phi fields) into an array dimension (e.g. length-3 dimension in the
  tensor `shape`). NumPy has a function for this,
  [np.lib.recfunctions.structured_to_unstructured](https://numpy.org/doc/2.1/user/basics.rec.html#numpy.lib.recfunctions.structured_to_unstructured),
  though the Awkward equivalent can have a different name (since it
  has different submodules). The labor-intensive steps described in
  [this StackOverflow
  answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79215978/1623645) and [this
  tutorial](https://hsf-training.github.io/deep-learning-intro-for-hep/25-ragged-data-and-graphs.html#building-permutation-invariance-into-the-model)
  could be encapsulated as ready-to-use functions. Also,
  PyTorch-Geometric (PyG) expects ragged arrays to be represented as
  an external array of integers, which Awkward Array could generate
  with a function (see
  [awkward#3256](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/issues/3256)). Yet
  another framework, [PyTorch
  Cluster](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_cluster), expects
  raggedness to be expressed as a list of tensors (see
  [awkward#3265](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/issues/3265)). All
  of these helper functions would simplify the conversion of Awkward
  Arrays into tensors for fixed-size NNs and GNNs.

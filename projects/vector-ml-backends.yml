shortdescription: "Adding TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends to Vector"
description: >
  Scikit-HEP's Vector library has several backends with different
  features, including a NumPy backend for flat or rectilinear arrays
  of Lorentz vectors. However, it would also benefit from TensorFlow,
  PyTorch, and/or JAX backends, since these could be used within an
  optimizable model with built-in
  autodiff. [vector#541](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector/pull/541)
  is a step in this direction for PyTorch.

shortdescription: Machine learning pileup suppression trigger algorithms at the HL-LHC
description: >
This project proposes to investigate new approaches to the challenge of pileup at the High Luminosity 
LHC (HL-LHC). The goal is to investigate and implement advanced methods for the selection of multi-jet 
signatures at the trigger level, addressing key experimental challenges that arise at high luminosity 
and require the development of new techniques. The project consists of utilizing simulated HL-LHC data 
to implement and study a new type of machine learning algorithm to tackle these new challenges and 
enhance the power of the HL-LHC to discover new physics.

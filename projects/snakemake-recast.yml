shortdescription: Implement a Snakemake backend for RECAST workflows
description: >
  [RECAST](https://iris-hep.org/projects/recast.html) is a platform for systematic
  interpretation of LHC searches.
  It reuses preserved analysis workflows from the LHC experiments, which is now possible
  with containerization and tools such as [REANA](http://reanahub.io).
  When RECAST was first implemented for ATLAS a workflow language with
  sufficient Linux container support was not available and the
  [yadage](https://github.com/yadage/yadage) workflow system was created.
  In the years since yadage was created the
  [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow management
  system has become increasingly popular in the broader scientific community and
  has developed mature Linux container support.
  This project would aim to implement another RECAST backend using Snakemake as a
  modern alternative to yadage.

shortdescription: Selecting vertices in high-luminosity high energy hadron colliders
description: >
  Future High luminosity LHC upgrades (HL-LHC) and high energy proton-proton colliders such as FCC-hh will 
  produce 200 – 1000 simultaneous vertex interactions per event, posing significant challenges to the 
  physics event reconstruction. At the LHC, we utilize algorithms that selects one “hard-scatter” vertex 
  among all reconstructed vertices. The ability to select the correct vertex using existing algorithms 
  degrade as the number of vertices continues to increase and new solutions will be required. This problem 
  is particularly challenging due to the fact that different physics process give rise to very different 
  event topologies making it difficult to design a single algorithm that can be broadly applicable to all 
  events. In this project, we propose to utilize advanced machine learning methods to develop the next 
  generation of vertex selection algorithms suitable for the very high luminosity hadron colliders of the future.

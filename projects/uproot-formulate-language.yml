shortdescription: 'Integrate Formulate into Uproot as a "language" for computing aliases'
description: >
  Recently, the
  [Formulate](https://github.com/scikit-hep/formulate/discussions/49)
  library was updated to parse any ROOT `TTree::Draw` expression (also
  known as `TFormula`) robustly and with high performance. Uproot's
  `expressions` and `aliases` arguments to
  [uproot.TTree.arrays](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/uproot.behaviors.TTree.TTree.html#arrays)
  and similar functions accept string expressions, but they are
  interpreted as Python strings. It would be more natural for them to
  accept `TTree::Draw` syntax, especially for `fAliases` embedded
  within the ROOT file. This project is to add a second
  [uproot.language](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5/tree/main/src/uproot/language)
  object that uses Formulate to interpret the strings in `TTree::Draw`
  syntax and add Formulate as a dependency of Uproot.

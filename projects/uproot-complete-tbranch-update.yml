shortdescription: "Add new columns to existing TTrees (99% done) and/or new rows (new project) in Uproot"
description: >
  Uproot can add new objects to existing ROOT files through
  [uproot.update](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/uproot.writing.writable.update.html),
  but it would be even more useful if it could modify existing TTrees
  in place. ZoÃ« Bilodeau implemented the ability to add new
  columns/TBranches, which is especially useful for backfilling data
  (e.g. adding an array of `False` for triggers that didn't exist at
  the time of data-taking). This implementation is nearly done (see
  [uproot#1155](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5/pull/1155)),
  apart from a few corner-cases that need to be tested and
  debugged. It would also be useful to be able to add rows/entries,
  which would be an entirely new project. Completing the
  adding-columns project would provide the experience necessary to
  tackle the adding-rows project.

shortdescription: Extending the [Alpaka](https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka) performance portability library with task-parallel constructs for the [CMS pixel reconstruction](https://github.com/cms-patatrack/pixeltrack-standalone/)
description: >
  This project proposes to extend the [Alpaka](https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka) performance portability library with task-parallel constructs,
  like task graphs and cooperative groups, and to evaluate their performance using them in the [pixel track](https://github.com/cms-patatrack/pixeltrack-standalone/)
  reconstruction software of the CMS experiment at CERN. As data volume and complexity surge, the CMS pixel
  reconstruction process, crucial for accurate particle tracking and collision event analysis, demands optimized
  computational strategies for timely data processing. Alpaka, facilitating development across diverse
  hardware architectures by providing a unified API for writing parallel software for CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs,
  will be extended with task graph and cooperative groups APIs to meet this demand.

  Integrating task graphs into Alpaka will streamline the scheduling and execution of interdependent tasks,
  optimizing resource utilization and reducing time-to-solution for complex data analyses.
  Cooperative groups will facilitate more flexible and efficient thread collaboration, crucial
  for fine-grained parallelism and dynamic workload distribution. These developments aim to
  improve the performance and scalability of CMS pixel track reconstruction algorithms,
  ensuring faster and more accurate data analysis for high-energy physics research.

  Students participating in this project will have the opportunity to contribute to programming
  a state-of-the-art C++ library, engaging directly with a developer group that adheres
  to the best software programming practices. They will gain hands-on experience in developing
  and implementing advanced computational solutions within a real-world scientific framework,
  enhancing their technical skills in high-performance computing and software development
  within a collaborative and cutting-edge research environment.

shortdescription: Building simple ML workflows for HEP applications
description: >
  In HEP, there are many ML methods and tasks that are common across experiments and across projects.
  Physics analysis projects often include boosted decision trees and neural nets, calorimeter clustering is sometimes 
  done with ML clustering, and graph neural nets are being explored for tracking.
  Building an ML pipeline can be a time-consuming task, especially for those new to the field. 
  This project will create a set of templates that people can use as a jumping-off point for their ML tasks.
  These templates will include the basic structure of a project, including data loading, preprocessing, model building,
  training, and evaluation.
  The templates will be written in Python and will use common ML libraries such as scikit-learn and PyTorch.
  Instead of being generic ML templates, these will be HEP specific, with examples of how to load and preprocess HEP data.
  This is a chance to learn best practices and get comfortable with a variety of ML models.
  For an overview of ML uses in HEP, see the [HEP-ML Living review](https://iml-wg.github.io/HEPML-LivingReview/).

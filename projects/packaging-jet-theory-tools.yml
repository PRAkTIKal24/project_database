shortdescription: Repackage the EnergyFlow and Wasserstein tools for modern PyPI and conda-forge
description: >
  In the area of jet substructure observable tools that leverage machine learning
  applications, the Python packages [EnergyFlow](https://github.com/thaler-lab/EnergyFlow) and
  [Wasserstein](https://github.com/thaler-lab/Wasserstein) stood out for their use in the broader
  high energy physics theory and experimental communities.
  The original project creators and maintainers have left the projects, and though the projects
  have been placed in a community organization to aid support, the packaging tooling choices
  have made it difficult to maintain the projects.

  This project would update the original SWIG-based Python bindings for the project C++ code
  to use [scikit-build-core](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/) and
  [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/) and update the CI/CD system to allow for fluid
  building and testing of the packages.
  The end deliverables of the project would be for the project repositories to have transitioned
  their packaging systems, updated their CI/CD systems, made new releases to the PyPI package
  index, and releases the packages to conda-forge.

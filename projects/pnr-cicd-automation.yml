shortdescription: Automate manual operations and implement CI/CD for CMS Production & Reprocessing group.
description: >
  The Production & Reprocessing (P&R) group is responsible for maintaining and operating the CMS central workload management system, which processes hundreds of
  physics workflows daily which produce the data that physicists use in their analyses. The requests which have a similar physics goal are grouped as
  ‘campaigns’. P&R manages the lifecycle of hundreds of campaigns, each with its unique needs. The objective of this project is to automate the checks that are
  performed manually on these campaigns. This involves creating a system to automatically set up, verify, and activate new campaigns, along with managing data
  storage and allocation. The second part of the project focuses on implementing a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for
  efficiently deploying and maintaining software services. This will include converting manual testing procedures into automated ones, improving overall
  efficiency and reducing errors. Tools such as Gitlab Pipelines for CI/CD, Python for scripting, and various automated testing frameworks will be employed.
  This initiative is designed to streamline operations, making them more efficient and effective.

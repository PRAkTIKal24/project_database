shortdescription: Research and development of scientific use cases\
  powered by the HEP Python-C++ ecosystem
description: |
  High-energy physics (HEP) presents a wide range of computational challenges
  that demand scalable, high-performance software solutions. While significant
  efforts have been made to develop robust and efficient tools, the diversity
  of scientific applications often extends beyond the original scope envisioned
  by software developers. As a result, there is a growing need to explore and
  develop novel scientific use cases that leverage modern computational techniques.

  Cutting-edge instruments able to collect unprecedented amounts of data such as
  radio telescopes, particle accelerators, and real-time AI inference in healthcare
  will go online by the 2030s. The seamless operation of these facilities demands
  nearly instantaneous data transfer from instruments to accelerator hardware,
  necessitating the development of next-generation software architectures and
  enhanced language interoperability. Unlike the current unidirectional interaction,
  future pipelines in C++ and Python must collaborate synergistically.

  The field of HEP has developed an on-demand synergy between high-performance
  languages such as CUDA C++ and fast prototyping languages such as Python.
  Tools such as [xeus-cpp](https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-cpp) explore
  high-performance scientific workflows. Existing examples prototyped with xeus-clang-repl
  (precursor to xeus-cpp) can be found
  [here](https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-clang-repl/tree/main/notebooks/kalman_CUDA_demo).
  The project aims to demonstrate low-latency interactions between C++ and Python in the context
  of various sciences such as physics and computational biology.

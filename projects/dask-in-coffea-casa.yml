shortdescription: How fast can large-scale HEP data analysis be performed using Dask and Awkward Arrays?

description: >
  [Coffea-casa](https://coffea-casa.readthedocs.io/) is a prototype Analysis
  Facility (AF), which provides services for "low-latency columnar analysis."
  [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) is an industry-standard scale-out mechanism for
  array-oriented data processing in Python, and Dask capabilities were recently
  added to Uproot and Awkward Array, making it possible to analyze jagged
  particle physics data from ROOT files as Dask arrays for the first time. The
  aim of this project is to determine how well these capabilities scale in a
  real AF environment. The project could be divided in the multiple sub-steps
  (depending on the timeline): adding CPU-intence CMS systematics to defined analysis workflow
  an/or perform the performance testing the [uproot.dask](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/uproot._dask.dask.html)
  and [dask-awkward](https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-awkward)
  implementations with defined workload, learning best-practices, and
  performance-testing/tuning in single and multi-user environments.

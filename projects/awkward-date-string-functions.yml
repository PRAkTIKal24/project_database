shortdescription: "More date & string functions and NumPy's new varlen string in Awkward Array"
description: >
  Awkward Array has a suite of string functions provided by Apache
  Arrow (in `ak.str.*`). However, it's missing a few string functions
  (see
  [awkward#2703](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/issues/2703))
  and it could also be useful to similarly wrap Arrow's date-handling
  functions (see
  [awkward#2702](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/issues/2702)),
  taking care to translate between NumPy's date format (which Awkward
  uses) and Arrow's date format. In addition, NumPy added a new
  variable-length string format that is different from all other such
  formats and it would be useful to convert to and from Awkward Arrays
  (see
  [awkward#3170](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/issues/3170)). Although
  most functionality can be added in Python, there's a slight chance
  that accessing NumPy's varlen strings would require C (not C++).

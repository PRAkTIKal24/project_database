shortdescription: Build a library on top of the pyhf Python API to
  allow for Bayesian analysis of HistFactory models
description: >
  Collider physics analyses have historically favored Frequentist
  statistical methodologies, with some exceptions of Bayesian inference in LHC
  analyses through use of the [Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT)](https://bat.github.io/BAT.jl/stable).
  As HistFactory's model construction
  allows for creation of models that can be interpreted
  as having Bayesian priors, HistFactory models built with
  [pyhf](https://pyhf.readthedocs.io/)
  can be used for both Frequentist and Bayesian analyses.
  The project goal is to build a library on top of the pyhf Python API to
  allow for Bayesian analysis of HistFactory models using the
  [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/) Python library and leverage pyhf's
  automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration through its
  [JAX](http://jax.readthedocs.io/) computational backend.
  Validation tests of results will be conducted against the BAT and
  [LiteHF](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/LiteHF.jl) Julia libraries.
  If time permits, work on integrating the functionality into pyhf
  would be possible, though it would not be expected to be completed
  in this Fellow project. Applicants are expected to have strong
  working experience with Python and basic knowledge
  of statistical analysis.
